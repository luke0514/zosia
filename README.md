# A Puzzle for Zosia

A ten-chapter mathematical and cryptographic ARG, built as a static site.

Every puzzle in it is real. The RSA modulus is a genuine 1024-bit key with a genuine
weakness. The elliptic curve is a genuine curve with a genuine smooth-order base point.
The zeta zeros are genuine zeros. The Enigma is a faithful Enigma I, double step and
all. Nothing is mocked, and `tools/solve.py` re-solves the whole thing from the
published data on every run to prove it.

> **If you are Zosia: stop here.** `PUZZLE_MASTER_GUIDE.md` is a complete spoiler, and
> so is `tools/solve.py`. Neither is served by the website. Go to the site instead.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

Building:

```bash
npm run build        # static export into ./out
npm run serve        # serve ./out at http://localhost:8099
```

Verifying — worth doing after any change to the puzzle data:

```bash
pip install sympy mpmath pillow cryptography
npm run verify           # re-solves all ten chapters from src/data (~2 min)
npm run verify:browser   # drives a real browser through the whole game
```

## Why a static export

The stack is the one that was asked for — Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind,
Framer Motion, KaTeX — but configured with `output: 'export'`, so `npm run build`
produces a plain folder of HTML, CSS and JS with no server component at all.

That is a deliberate choice rather than a fallback:

- **It deploys anywhere.** Vercel, Netlify and GitHub Pages all serve the same `out/`
  directory identically. So does an S3 bucket, or a USB stick.
- **There is no backend to leak.** Answer checking is a SHA-256 comparison in the
  browser; the final message is AES-GCM ciphertext in the bundle. A server would have
  to be trusted, kept alive, and paid for — for a puzzle meant to still work in a year,
  that is a liability, not a feature.
- **It cannot go down.** The intended solving time is months.

The only cost is that a static site can be read. That is addressed below, and it is
addressed honestly: the goal is spoiler resistance, not security.

## Deployment

### Vercel

Import the repository. Vercel detects Next.js and reads `vercel.json`. No environment
variables are needed — Vercel serves from the domain root.

```bash
npm i -g vercel && vercel --prod
```

### Netlify

Import the repository; `netlify.toml` sets the command (`npm run build`) and the publish
directory (`out`). No environment variables needed.

```bash
npm i -g netlify-cli && netlify deploy --prod
```

### GitHub Pages

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` does it on every push to `main`. Enable it once:

**Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions.**

The one subtlety is that a project site is served from `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>`
rather than from `/`, so every asset URL needs that prefix. The workflow passes it in as
`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` derived from the repository name, and `next.config.mjs` applies
it to `basePath` and `assetPrefix`. `src/lib/paths.ts` applies it to the files in
`public/`. Building for Pages by hand:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/your-repo-name npm run build
touch out/.nojekyll     # or Pages will hide the _next/ directory
```

Use a custom domain at the apex and you can drop the base path entirely.

`src/data/*` is generated. To change any puzzle's numbers, edit the corresponding
script in `tools/generators/`, re-run it, then `npm run generate` to re-emit the
TypeScript, then `npm run verify`.

## How the puzzle machinery works

**Answers.** `normalise()` strips diacritics (including `Ł`, which has no NFD
decomposition and needs its own rule), drops everything outside `A–Z0–9`, and
uppercases. So `polska matematyka zmieniła historię` and
`POLSKAMATEMATYKAZMIENILAHISTORIE` are the same answer. The normalised string is
hashed as `SHA-256("zosia/<chapter>/<answer>")` and compared with a digest in
`src/data/sealed.ts`. The answer itself is never in the bundle.

**Unlocking.** Chapter *n* opens when chapter *n−1* is solved. A locked chapter renders
a closed door and never mounts its body, so its data does not reach the DOM.

**Hints.** Four per chapter, from vague to nearly explicit. A hint becomes *earned*
after time on the chapter or after enough wrong answers — but an unearned hint can
still be opened. It says *"Some answers are more satisfying when discovered alone"*
first, and then it opens, because a puzzle that decides for you how much help you
deserve is not respecting you.

**Progress.** One `localStorage` key, exportable as JSON from the contents page.
Nothing is transmitted anywhere; there is no analytics, no backend, no account.

**The seal.** The closing text of Chapter 10 is AES-256-GCM ciphertext. Its key is
PBKDF2-SHA256 (310,000 iterations) over all nine chapter answers *plus* the final
passphrase. Reading the source gets you a base64 blob. There is no code path that
produces the text without the answers, and if GCM authentication fails the page simply
says *"Not that."*

If Chapter 10 is reached on a browser that never solved the earlier chapters — a
different device, cleared storage — it notices, and offers nine fields to type the
recovered sentences back in. Nothing is lost.

**On spoiler resistance.** This is not security. A determined reader with the bundle
and a dictionary could attack the per-chapter digests, and someone who did that would
have worked harder than they would have solving Chapter 01. What is genuinely
protected is the *ending*: the confession never exists in the bundle in any readable
form, and no amount of source-reading assembles it without the nine answers.

## Fonts

Cormorant Garamond and IBM Plex Mono are loaded with a stylesheet `<link>` rather than
`next/font`. `next/font` downloads the files at **build** time, which means a build
machine with no route to `fonts.googleapis.com` cannot build the project at all. A link
moves that dependency into the browser, where it degrades to the fallback stack
(Georgia, `ui-monospace`) instead of failing. `optimizeFonts: false` in
`next.config.mjs` keeps the build from trying to fetch and inline the stylesheet.

To self-host instead: drop the `.woff2` files into `src/fonts/`, switch `layout.tsx` to
`next/font/local`, and delete the `<link>` tags.

---

## Accessibility

- Every interactive element is reachable and operable by keyboard. The evasive **NIE**
  button moves on pointer hover only — under keyboard focus it holds still and keeps
  its label, because the joke stops being funny the moment it removes the choice.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` stops the ambient drift, the reveal timing collapses to
  near-instant, and all transitions are disabled globally in `globals.css`.
- Chapter data tables carry captions and scoped headers; the plot has a text-table twin
  right beneath it, because a scatter is not a dataset.
- Text sits at or above WCAG AA against `#060a12` (`#e3eaf4` ≈ 15:1, `#7a8ca4` ≈ 6.4:1).
  The dimmest tones are used only for decoration, never for content.
- Sound is off by default and synthesised in the browser — no files, no autoplay.

## Responsiveness

Optimised for desktop, correct everywhere. Long integers wrap; KaTeX display blocks and
wide tables scroll inside their own containers so the page body never scrolls
horizontally. The Enigma collapses to a single column below `lg`. The browser test
asserts zero horizontal overflow at 390 px.

## Adding a chapter

1. Add its message to `MESSAGES` in `tools/generators/ch10.py` and re-run it — this
   regenerates the digests *and* the final passphrase, since the passphrase is derived
   from every chapter message.
2. Append an entry to `CHAPTERS` in `src/chapters/registry.ts`: id, order, slug,
   numeral, title, theme, placeholder, `answerHash: ANSWER_HASHES.chNN`, and four hints.
3. Create `src/chapters/ChapterNN.tsx` — take `Chapter02.tsx` as the template.
4. Register the slug in `BODIES` in `src/components/ChapterView.tsx`.
5. Add a section to `tools/solve.py` and run `npm run verify`.

The route, the lock, the progress dots, the contents page and the hint system all read
from the registry and need no changes.

## The documents

- `PUZZLE_MASTER_GUIDE.md` — every solution, every red herring, every hint. **Spoilers.**
- `tools/solve.py` — the same thing as executable code. **Spoilers.**

Neither is reachable from the website; both are in the repository. If you host this
publicly and Zosia might find the repository, keep the site in a separate repository
from these two files.
